                As time passed, Astro grew envious of other avatars — he wanted one that would become his true identity. After consulting with Celestia0201, they chose the Turkey skin. ASTROAWESOMENESS10 and Celestia0201 were gone, reborn as TURKEY1 and TURKEY2. Together, the two Turkeys continued to roam Roblox, dominating titles like Super Doomspire, Jailbreak, Build A Boat For Treasure, and Work At A Pizza Place. Their fame swelled to the point that players they’d never met instantly recognized them on sight.

                Rivals christened them the “Turkey Twins” or the “Turkey Teamers.” They perfected the art of ragebaiting — so effective that mass reports followed them everywhere, yet nothing could fully stop them. TURKEY1 pushed the envelope too far once, making racist remarks that led to a termination; after desperate appeals, Roblox reinstated the account.

                Then disaster struck. One morning TURKEY1 logged in and found an ugly noob avatar where his Turkey should have been. At first he assumed it was a temporary bug, but he soon learned Roblox had decided to remove the Turkey avatar entirely. It felt like something essential had been ripped away — a loss so raw it left him adrift. He sank into a deep depression and struggled to find his footing again.
