            21 December 2019 — upon consultation with "stealthninjamaster10" (Stealth)
            and "AstroElite" (EliteTheMagnificent), an account was created which would
            go on to become the greatest Roblox account ever made, in just a few years’ time.<br><br>

            Combining Stealth’s "10", Elite’s "Astro", and my own awesomeness, that day gave
            birth to the infamous and glorified "ASTROAWESOMENESS10."<br><br>

            The three of us would go on to conquer an array of games: Hide and Seek Extreme,
            Natural Disaster Survival, Theme Park Tycoon, Epic Minigames — and the list goes on.<br><br>

            Many acquaintances were made along the way, but a few were lost. Particularly,
            EliteTheMagnificent. He sadly departed after becoming an anime merchant, and is
            remembered to this day — for he was the chosen one, destined to destroy the anime,
            not join them; to bring balance to Roblox, not leave it in darkness.<br><br>

            ASTROAWESOMENESS10 continued his journey alongside Stealth, and a new companion —
            Celestia0201, a member of ASTRO’s private domicile. The legendary trio was gone,
            but two lethal duos had now been forged: Stealth and ASTRO, Celestia and ASTRO.<br><br>

            All was well, as ASTRO conquered game after game — but little did he know,
            there was far more destined for him.
